# On the Travis CI server, this directory contains a .blend.properties file with the Galaxy instance URLs and the 
# corresponding API keys that are used for testing.

# The steps below were used to prepare the .blend.properties.enc file and the environment variables on the Travis CI
# server. (Side note: these steps were done on a Linux machine, which was easier than with a Windows machine.)

# Install Ruby and travis (the Travis command-line client).

sudo apt-get install ruby
sudo gem install travis


# Set the BLEND_PROPERTIES_DIRECTORY environment variable (which is used in the GalaxyConfiguration class).

travis env set BLEND_PROPERTIES_DIRECTORY src/configuration/travis-blend4j-properties
travis env list


# Encrypt your private .blend.properties file, add the decryption command to the .travis.yml file, and add the encrypted
# .blend.properties.enc file to the git repository. While the travis command performs the encrypt-file function, it
# stores secure environment variables for decryption on the Travis CI server.

travis encrypt-file src/configuration/travis-blend4j-properties/.blend.properties --add
git add src/configuration/travis-blend4j-properties/.blend.properties.enc
git commit -m "Added encoded .blend.properties file for Travis CI." src/configuration/travis-blend4j-properties/.blend.properties.enc
