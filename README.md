# Workflow Runner


This tool is part of a larger project to connect tranSMART to Galaxy, which is made possible by the [BioMedBridges](http://www.biomedbridges.eu/) and [CTMM TraIT](http://www.ctmm-trait.nl/) projects.

The goal of this tool is to make it easy to run a workflow in Galaxy using the Galaxy API. The Workflow Runner tool is written in Java and uses the blend4j library for accessing Galaxy servers.
